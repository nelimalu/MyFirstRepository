a* pathfinder by Luka Jovanovic in Python

grid test with drawing.py is just a grid where you can draw.
AStarPathFinder uses that grid to display the pathfinding.

When the program is opened there will be a 25x25 grid with two filled in squares.
The red square indicates the starting point of the program
The blue square indicates the goal of the program
Using left click, you can draw barriers for the pathfinder to make it's way around.
Use right click to remove barriers thay you have misplaced.
Use the "r" key to reset all the barriers on the screen.
Once you feel that your barriers are complete, press the return key on your keyboard.
Now the program is running.
After a few seconds, there will be a pink line indicating a path from the start to end.

The program is still a bit broken because it doesn't always find the shortes distance,
but I am still working on fixing that.
