I used the a* algorithm to make a snake AI

It can usually get up to around a score of 70, but I'm going to work on that.

One major problem is that it calculates the path from it's head to the food as soon as
it eats something. This means even if the snake moves out of the way, it will still go
around a long-gone body. The program will freeze if it thinks there are no possible
paths from the head to the food.

Other than that, I think it turned out extremely well.
